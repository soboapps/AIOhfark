# OhFark (Farkle)
Farkle game for Android

OhFark (Farkle) is a fun dice game that can be played by the entire family! Watch it, it's addicting!

OhFark is a dice game that has also been called or is similar to 1000/5000/10000, Cosmic Wimpout, Greed, Hot Dice, Squelch, Zilch, Zonk, or Darsh to name but a few. 

OhFark is played by two players (Not Online), with each player in succession having a turn at rolling the dice. Each player's turn results in a score, and the scores for each player accumulate to some winning total (usually 10,000).

At the beginning of each turn, the player rolls all of the dice.
After each roll, one or more scoring dice must be selected.
The player may then either end their turn and bank the score accumulated so far by passing, or continue to roll the remaining dice.
If the player has scored all six dice, they have "hot dice" and may continue their turn with a new roll of all six dice, adding to the score they have already accumulated. There is no limit to the number of "hot dice" a player may roll in one turn.
If none of the dice score in any given throw, the player has "farkled" and all points for that turn are lost.
At the end of the player's turn, the dice are passed to the next player and they have their turn.
Once a player has achieved a winning point total, the other player has one last turn to score enough points to surpass that high-score.
